# Artificial intelligence and medical practitioners hand in hand 

###### Blog Post written by Noura Eltahawi.

## *Introduction*

Artificial intelligence is currently occupying a huge part of our lives, from auto-driving cars and auto pilot in planes to virtual assistants in devices and smart homes. Correspondingly, AI is currently on its way to conquer a big part of medical/patient care institutions like hospitals and clinics. According to Statista: 
> “In 2021, 42 percent of healthcare organizations in the European Union were currently using AI technologies for disease diagnosis, while a further 19 percent had plans to employ this technology within in the next three years.”

## *Improved patient diagnosis with the aid of AI*

Correct diagnosis is a crucial step towards treatment, the reason is that misdiagnosis leads to false treatment which could worsen a patient’s condition. According to iCloud hospital almost a quarter of the European Union’s citizens are either affected by inaccurate diagnosis or have a family member who was misdiagnosed. In recent years, AI and machine code have proved that they can cause a turnover in the medical diagnosis field but unfortunately to this day they have only been implemented into the health care system of many countries. One of the most famous approaches of implementing AI for patient diagnosis was done by Babylon Health, a digital healthcare provider based in the UK, where AI was designed to ‘imagine’ the possibility of a patient’s symptoms being due to different conditions. This new approach overcomes the limitations in earlier versions by using machine code to give casual reasoning instead of blurting out diagnosis merely based on the correlation between symptoms and the most likely cause. Another successful approach was done by researchers from the University of Bonn where AI was used to improve the diagnosis of Leukaemia using blood samples. They developed a machine learning program established on examining blood or bone marrow for the presence of cancerous cells. Dr Peter Krawitz, head of the University of Bonn research group, reported that this technology doesn’t only increase the speed and objectivity of Leukaemia diagnosis but also reduces costs. 

## *AI and surgeries*

The concept of using AI and robots in surgeries is not new, intelligent robots have been in place in surgery since 1980 (PUMA 560 was used for conducting neurosurgical biopsies in 1985). Nevertheless AI is unfortunately still not fully imbedded in surgical procedures. While surgical robots are the most famous form of AI used in surgeries it is not the one and only way of using AI in surgical operations. Artificial intelligence can be used to guide surgeons during minimally invasive surgical procedures such as with heart diseases, an example of this is the way Cloud-based AI is used in detecting blood vessel’s blockage during heart operations by analyzing automatically produced CT-scan images and informing the physician with the results. AI doesn’t only have to be used during surgeries but also before them. AI can predict when medical equipment will need maintenance through remote sensing which would prevent interruption of clinical care and unneeded patient delay. There is no doubt that post-surgical care is also important for full patient recovery; AI can be used to monitor patient’s vitals for signs of postsurgical deterioration and sharing this with the medical team immediately, this doesn’t only save the wasted time taken to manually record vitals and reduces errors but also allows care teams to respond rapidly. According to Phillips Inc. one hospital managed to reduce serious adverse events in the general ward by 35% and cardiac arrests by more than 86% by using AI-enabled tools.

## *Management of medical records and paperwork* 

According to Forbes a study showed that doctors spend only 27% of their time seeing patients while wasting 49.2% of their time doing paperwork, and even when seeing patients physicians spend 53% of the time talking to or examining patients and 37% doing even more paperwork!. The usage of AI would save a lot of this wasted time, a personal experience of mine is when visiting the doctor in the UAE where he/she would record the symptoms and the treatment using voice recognition instead of manually typing/writing them themselves or asking a nurse to do it. Although the amount of medical data being stored in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are increasing day by day this data is often inflexible, difficult to use and expensive to maintain; in addition the amount of data doubles every 5 years which makes it very tough for clinicians to manually maintain it. AI comes in handy in this situation to allow physicians to provide better care for their patients by automating the tasks, analysing them, categorizing the data in a patient-specific matter and delivering the required information to the doctor immediately, this allows doctors to focus less on the monitor and keyboard and more with the patient.

## *Will AI ever replace doctors?* 

AI will impact a lot of health care workers, its ability to automate tasks can lead to some people losing their jobs as their services are no longer required and on the other hand AI needs to be monitored and maintained which would create other jobs. The occupation which will for sure be present nevertheless if AI is used or not is physicians. No matter how intelligent AI gets it can’t imitate empathy or construct common sense- at least not in the near future. Another reason for the slim possibility of AI replacing doctors is that patients don’t trust that AI can correctly treat them, according to ScienceDirect Journal: “The general population is more distrustful of AI in medicine unlike the overall optimistic views posed in the media.” Add to that, the health sector can I find it difficult to replace clinicians with AI due to financial aspects (AI technology is quite expensive to install and maintain).

## *Conclusion*

By listing many of the advantages of embedding AI into the healthcare system- along with some disadvantages- governments and health innovation leaders should speed up the implantation of AI into hospitals and clinics to provide better patientcare for this generation and the coming ones.
