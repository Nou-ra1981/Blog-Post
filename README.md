##  Artificial intelligence and medical practitioners hand in hand

Introduction
Artificial intelligence is currently occupying a huge part of our lives, from auto-driving cars and auto pilot in planes to virtual assistants in devices and smart homes. Correspondingly, AI is currently on its way to conquer a big part of medical/patient care institutions like hospitals and clinics. According to Statista “In 2021, 42 percent of healthcare organizations in the European Union were currently using AI technologies for disease diagnosis, while a further 19 percent had plans to employ this technology within in the next three years.”

Improved patient diagnosis with the aid of AI
Correct diagnosis is a crucial step towards treatment, the reason is that misdiagnosis leads to false treatment which could worsen a patient’s condition. According to iCloud hospital almost a quarter of the European Union’s citizens are either affected by inaccurate diagnosis or have a family member who was misdiagnosed. In recent years, AI and machine code have proved that they can cause a turnover in the medical diagnosis field but unfortunately to this day they have only been implemented into the health care system of many countries. One of the most famous approaches of implementing AI for patient diagnosis was done by Babylon Health, a digital healthcare provider based in the UK, where AI was designed to ‘imagine’ the possibility of a patient’s symptoms being due to different conditions. This new approach overcomes the limitations in earlier versions by using machine code to give casual reasoning instead of blurting out diagnosis merely based on the correlation between symptoms and the most likely cause. Another successful approach was done by researchers from the University of Bonn where AI was used to improve the diagnosis of Leukaemia using blood samples. They developed a machine learning program established on examining blood or bone marrow for the presence of cancerous cells. Dr Peter Krawitz, head of the University of Bonn research group, reported that this technology doesn’t only increase the speed and objectivity of Leukaemia diagnosis but also reduces costs.
